Server Actions & Form Handling

💡 What I Learned:
This project wasn’t just about code — it gave me deep insights into:

✅ Dynamic Routing & Nested Layouts

✅ Server & Client Components

✅ Form Actions with Server Functions

✅ useFormStatus() & useFormState() to handle UI feedback

✅ revalidatePath() to handle SSR cache correctly

✅ Handling real-world app flows: loading, error boundaries, and more!
